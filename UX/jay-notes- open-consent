secretary needs to record the results of a meeting. 

method. 

generation of organisational policy 



i want search for information in various ways about what has already happened. 

everything that has been agreed is then an organisational policy. 


nate: sits on laptop with notes and has memories. 
cuts and pastes and transcribing to put agreements made and access them later on. sitting in a cafe. 

google sites. really useful, wants to be more automatic. double operation.

currently for expert users. 

a notetaker taking notes at the same time. 
an agreement part. so that there isn't so much clicking and scrolling. 

proposal

questions, reactions, cross discussion, collecting concerns. 
work through concerns one by one and modify proposal until you have a proposal with significant concerns. otherwise concerns can be set aside with notes attached. 

as a secretary is that i have to clear and i have to be quick. categories. is that a question, answer, concern, proposal, modification, new proposal, action point, agreement. need to listen to these. i'll put bold print around a proposal, a star for an agreement. obvious what they are looking at. export to log.

not a tool for organising meetings. just for logging results and searching for them. 

once published. anyone can see what policy decisions are. review date. 


as a member of the organisation i want to review items pending review. 


meeting tool. logging tool. decision making tool.
