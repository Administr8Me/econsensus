      "description": "We allow our bunnies to play in an outdoor pen everyday where they could munch on fresh grass and dig holes and do all the natural things bunnies do.  We also gave them treats of fresh apples right off our tree and carrots and lettuce. We moved the playpen every week so that new grass could grow and the bunnies could laze around on fresh grown grass.\r\nNeedless to say these bunnies had quite the life. Only one thing was missing, a boyfriend.\r\n\r\nWe borrowed a male bunny from the farm where we board our horse. A male bunny is called a \"Buck\". His breed was part Angora/Rex part Dwarf. He was quite a funky looking bunny but we thought he'll do. Both girl bunnies took to their new friend right away. And even though we let him stay over for a few nights in his own pen, it only took a few minutes for him to do his business. After we returned him to his home our girl bunnies went about their normal routine eating apples and digging burrows.\r\nSoon we discovered they were making a warren because they tunneled down through the ground and up over the other side of their pen.\r\nThey did manage to get out a few times and it took about 4 of us to round them up.\r\n\r\n28 Days later... our 13 baby bunnies were born!

      "description": "Rabbits are active, playful and social. Entertaining to watch, a rabbit can be a very rewarding pet. Their popularity as a pet is growing. They are quiet and do not demand a lot of attention. Properly socialized rabbits are relatively calm and enjoy being around their people. They will allow you to hold them but lots of times they would rather not be held. Rabbits can be litter box trained. Indoor rabbits will love to hop around your house, however rabbits like to chew. If you allow your rabbit to roam free in your house or outside for that matter, be sure to keep things you do not wish the rabbit to chew out of his reach. Rabbits will chew things such as furniture, curtains and wires. You may want to look into cord protectors, found in most mail order pet supply catalogs. Chewed wires are dangerous for the rabbit and can also be a fire hazard for you. A rabbit must be provided with things it is allowed to chew such as a block of wood. Because most rabbits do not like to be held and cuddled, a rabbit may not be a good choice of a pet for very active children who may not be careful when picking them up or playing around them. Rabbits can be destructive if deprived of attention and appropriate toys. Rabbits are crepuscular, which means they are more active during twilight hours (around 10 p.m.). They sleep most of the daylight hours. Some rabbits will sleep with their eyes open. When rabbits sleep they will often twitch, and their noses stop wiggling. A happy rabbit will sometimes jump up into the air twisting and flicking its feet and head. Rabbits will show they are unhappy, startled, or warn of danger by thumping their back feet. If a rabbit grunts or squeaks when you touch it, it may be telling you it does not wish to be touched or it may be displaying territorial behavior. Rabbits that are territorial can become aggressive when you suddenly stick your hand into their territory. Spaying and neutering rabbits greatly reduces the risk of this behavior. A rabbit will squeal to express extreme fear or pain. A rabbit that has never been caught by a person may squeal in fear as it is picked up from the ground.",

Never in his life had he seen a river before--this sleek, sinuous, full-bodied animal, chasing and chuckling, gripping things with a gurgle and leaving them with a laugh, to fling itself on fresh playmates that shook themselves free, and were caught and held again.\" Such is the cautious, agreeable Mole's first introduction to the river and the Life Adventurous. Emerging from his home at Mole End one spring, his whole world changes when he hooks up with the good-natured, boat-loving Water Rat, the boastful Toad of Toad Hall, the society- hating Badger who lives in the frightening Wild Wood, and countless other mostly well-meaning creatures.",

      "description": "The Mole had been working very hard all the morning, spring- cleaning his little home. First with brooms, then with dusters; then on ladders and steps and chairs, with a brush and a pail of whitewash; till he had dust in his throat and eyes, and splashes of whitewash all over his black fur, and an aching back and weary arms. Spring was moving in the air above and in the earth below and around him, penetrating even his dark and lowly little house with its spirit of divine discontent and longing. It was small wonder, then, that he suddenly flung down his brush on the floor, said `Bother!' and `O blow!' and also `Hang spring-cleaning!' and bolted out of the house without even waiting to put on his coat. Something up above was calling him imperiously, and he made for the steep little tunnel which answered in his case to the gravelled carriage-drive owned by animals whose residences are nearer to the sun and air. So he scraped and scratched and scrabbled and scrooged and then he scrooged again and scrabbled and scratched and scraped, working busily with his little paws and muttering to himself, `Up we go! Up we go!' till at last, pop! his snout came out into the sunlight, and he found himself rolling in the warm grass of a great meadow.",

      "description": "`This is fine!' he said to himself. `This is better than whitewashing!' The sunshine struck hot on his fur, soft breezes caressed his heated brow, and after the seclusion of the cellarage he had lived in so long the carol of happy birds fell on his dulled hearing almost like a shout. Jumping off all his four legs at once, in the joy of living and the delight of spring without its cleaning, he pursued his way across the meadow till he reached the hedge on the further side.\r\n\r\n`Hold up!' said an elderly rabbit at the gap. `Sixpence for the privilege of passing by the private road!' He was bowled over in an instant by the impatient and contemptuous Mole, who trotted along the side of the hedge chaffing the other rabbits as they peeped hurriedly from their holes to see what the row was about. `Onion-sauce! Onion-sauce!' he remarked jeeringly, and was gone before they could think of a thoroughly satisfactory reply. Then they all started grumbling at each other. `How STUPID you are! Why didn't you tell him----' `Well, why didn't YOU say----' `You might have reminded him----' and so on, in the usual way; but, of course, it was then much too late, as is always the case.",

      "description": "It all seemed too good to be true. Hither and thither through the meadows he rambled busily, along the hedgerows, across the copses, finding everywhere birds building, flowers budding, leaves thrusting--everything happy, and progressive, and occupied. And instead of having an uneasy conscience pricking him and whispering `whitewash!' he somehow could only feel how jolly it was to be the only idle dog among all these busy citizens. After all, the best part of a holiday is perhaps not so much to be resting yourself, as to see all the other fellows busy working.\r\n\r\nHe thought his happiness was complete when, as he meandered aimlessly along, suddenly he stood by the edge of a full-fed river.

All was a-shake and a-shiver--glints and gleams and sparkles, rustle and swirl, chatter and bubble. The Mole was bewitched, entranced, fascinated. By the side of the river he trotted as one trots, when very small, by the side of a man who holds one spell-bound by exciting stories; and when tired at last, he sat on the bank, while the river still chattered on to him, a babbling procession of the best stories in the world, sent from the heart of the earth to be told at last to the insatiable sea.",
